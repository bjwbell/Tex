The purpose of the game is to get as
high a score as you can. You achieve this by having lines eaten away.
The way it works is there is a eater block that eats it's way
across the screen. The rate at which it eats depends on
how many blank spaces it comes upon. The more blank spaces it eats the 
slower it eats which is bad for you because blocks come down
faster and faster.
